## Summary

This repository contents data analysis projects which I've been working on during my studying and exploration in the Data Science field. All the projects are created mostly in Python using Jupyter Notebooks. Feel free to contact me and have a talk about interesting collaboration, new opportunities, or if you have any questions: [avtrrr@gmail.com](mailto:avtrrr@gmail.com)

## Data Analysis

* **The forecasting of an average wage in Russia** ([nbviewer](#))

* **Mobile Games AB-testing with Cookie Cats** ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/AB-testing%20from%20the%20Cookie%20Cats.ipynb)). As players progress through the levels of the game, they will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait or make an in-app purchase to progress. The target of this project is to decide where to place the gate looking at the impact on player retention.

* **Risk and Returns: The Sharpe Ratio** ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Risk%20%26%20Returns%20with%20the%20Sharpe%20Ratio.ipynb)). Using `pandas` to calculate and compare profitability and risks of different investments using the Sharpe Ratio.

* **Exploring the Bitcoin cryptocurrency market** ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Exploring%20The%20Bitcoin%20Cryptocurrency%20Market.ipynb)). Exploring the market capitalization of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

## Competitions
* **Avito Demand Prediction Challenge** (in progress). Kaggle Featured Competition.

* **Home Credit Deafault Risk** (in progress). Kaggle Featured Competition.

* **Catch me if you can: Intruder Detection** (244/1163). In-class competition during ML Course Open by [ODS](http://www.ods.ai).

## Pet Projects
* **TweetLikeTrump** is a web application which can measure the similarity between yours and Donald Trump's written text. 

* **LibDS** - curated list of Data Science books. It's a [repository](https://github.com/atrof/LibDS) and I\`m developing a "library-like" website using Django framework.

* **AIgift** is a web service which can (or not :D ) help you to choose the most suitable gift for your friend on the basis of his/her public data. Just in the very beginning but baught *aigift.io* domain :)

## Others
