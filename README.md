## Data Analysis Projects

* **The forecasting of the average wage in Russia** ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Wage_forecasting.ipynb)). Time Series analysis task.

* **Mobile Games AB-testing with Cookie Cats** ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/AB-testing%20from%20the%20Cookie%20Cats.ipynb)). As players progress through the levels of the game, they will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait or make an in-app purchase to progress. The target of this project is to decide where to place the gate looking at the impact on player retention.

* **Risk and Returns: The Sharpe Ratio** ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Risk%20%26%20Returns%20with%20the%20Sharpe%20Ratio.ipynb)). Using `pandas` to calculate and compare profitability and risks of different investments using the Sharpe Ratio.

* **Exploring the Bitcoin cryptocurrency market** ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Exploring%20The%20Bitcoin%20Cryptocurrency%20Market.ipynb)). Exploring the market capitalization of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

* **Tweet Like Trump** (in progress, [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/TweetLikeTrump.ipynb)). NLP experiments for [TweetLikeTrump](#) pet-project.

## Competitions
My Kaggle [profile](https://www.kaggle.com/avtrrr) and the [list of competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/avtrrr/competitions). 

* **Avito Demand Prediction Challenge** (in progress). [Kaggle Featured Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-demand-prediction) aimed at predicting demand for an online advertisement based on its description, its context and historical demand for similar ads in similar contexts. 

* **Home Credit Deafault Risk** (in progress). [Kaggle Featured Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk). The goal of this challenge is to predict how capable each applicant is of repaying a loan.

* **Catch me if you can: Intruder Detection** (Top 21%, 244/1163). [In-class competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2) during ML Course Open by [ODS](http://www.ods.ai). The goal is to identify a user on the Internet tracking his/her sequence of attended web pages and predict whether it belongs to the specific user (Alice) or somebody else.

* **How good is your Medium article?** (Top 15%, 59/398). [In-class competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/how-good-is-your-medium-article) during ML Course Open by [ODS](http://www.ods.ai). The task was to predict the number of "claps" (some like recommendations) for an article published on Medium.

## Pet-Projects
* **TweetLikeTrump** (in progress, [repository](https://github.com/atrof/TweetLikeTrump)) - Flask-based [web application](https://tweetliketrump.herokuapp.com/) which can measure the similarity between yours and Donald Trump's written text. Just for fun and NLP experiments. 

* **AIgift** (in progress) is a Django-based web application which can help you to choose the most suitable gift for your friend on the basis of his/her public data. Just in the very beginning but [AIgift is available online](http://aigift.pythonanywhere.com) already in dev-mode.

## Others
* **3200tweets** is a simple Python [script for grabbing tweets](https://github.com/atrof/3200tweets) using Twitter API and Tweepy package.
* **Dask: when Pandas fails** is an intro [article about Dask library](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/mlcourse_open/blob/master/jupyter_russian/tutorials/dask_dataframe_avt.ipynb) (in Russian). 
* **LibDS** is a curated list of Data Science books. It's just a [repository](https://github.com/atrof/LibDS) but I develop a "library-like" website using Django framework.
