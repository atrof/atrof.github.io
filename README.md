## Summary

This repository contents data analysis projects which I've been working on during my studying and exploration in the Data Science field. All the projects are created in Python using Jupyter Notebooks. Feel free to contact me and have a talk about interesting collaboration, new opportunities, or if you have any questions: [avtrrr@gmail.com](mailto:avtrrr@gmail.com)

## Data Analysis

* **The forecasting of the average wage in Russia** ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Wage_forecasting.ipynb)). Time Series forecasting task.

* **Mobile Games AB-testing with Cookie Cats** ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/AB-testing%20from%20the%20Cookie%20Cats.ipynb)). As players progress through the levels of the game, they will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait or make an in-app purchase to progress. The target of this project is to decide where to place the gate looking at the impact on player retention.

* **Risk and Returns: The Sharpe Ratio** ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Risk%20%26%20Returns%20with%20the%20Sharpe%20Ratio.ipynb)). Using `pandas` to calculate and compare profitability and risks of different investments using the Sharpe Ratio.

* **Exploring the Bitcoin cryptocurrency market** ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Exploring%20The%20Bitcoin%20Cryptocurrency%20Market.ipynb)). Exploring the market capitalization of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

* **Tweet Like Trump** (in progress, [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/TweetLikeTrump.ipynb)). Jupyter notebook with NLP experiments for [TweetLikeTrump](#) pet-project.

## Competitions
My Kaggle [profile](https://www.kaggle.com/avtrrr) and the [list of comtetions](https://www.kaggle.com/avtrrr/competitions). 

* **Avito Demand Prediction Challenge** (in progress). [Kaggle Featured Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-demand-prediction) aimed at predicting demand for an online advertisement based on its description, its context and historical demand for similar ads in similar contexts. 

* **Home Credit Deafault Risk** (in progress). [Kaggle Featured Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk). The goal of this challenge is to predict how capable each applicant is of repaying a loan.

* **Catch me if you can: Intruder Detection** (Top 21%, 244/1163). [In-class competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2) during ML Course Open by [ODS](http://www.ods.ai). The goal is to identify a user on the Internet tracking his/her sequence of attended web pages and predict whether it belongs to the specific user (Alice) or somebody else.

* **How good is your Medium article?** (Top 15%, 59/398). [In-class competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/how-good-is-your-medium-article) during ML Course Open by [ODS](http://www.ods.ai). The task was to predict the number of "claps" (some like recommendations) for an article published on Medium.

## Pet Projects
* **TweetLikeTrump** (in progress, [repository](https://github.com/atrof/TweetLikeTrump)) - Flask-based [web application](#) which can measure the similarity between yours and Donald Trump's written text. Just for fun and NLP experiments. 

* **AIgift** (in progress) is a Django-based web application which can help you to choose the most suitable gift for your friend on the basis of his/her public data. Just in the very beginning but [AIgift is available online](http://aigift.pythonanywhere.com) already in dev-mode.

## Others
* **3200tweets** is a simple Python [script for grabbing tweets](https://github.com/atrof/3200tweets) using Twitter API and Tweepy package.
* **Dask: when Pandas fails** is an intro [article about Dask library](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/mlcourse_open/blob/master/jupyter_russian/tutorials/dask_dataframe_avt.ipynb) (in Russian). 
* **LibDS** (in progress) is a curated list of Data Science books. It's just a [repository](https://github.com/atrof/LibDS) but I develop a "library-like" website using Django framework.
