## PROFILE

Portfolio contents my skill-set, list of courses and data analysis projects which I've been working on during my study and exploration in the Data Science field. All the projects are created in Python using Jupyter Notebooks. Feel free to contact me and have a talk about interesting collaboration, new opportunities, or if you have any questions: [avtrrr@gmail.com](mailto:avtrrr@gmail.com)

## PET PROJECTS
* **TweetLikeTrump** (in progress, [repository](https://github.com/atrof/TweetLikeTrump)) - Flask-based [web application](https://tweetliketrump.herokuapp.com/) which can measure the similarity between yours and Donald Trump's written text. Just for fun and NLP experiments.<br>

* **LibDS** is a curated list of Data Science books. It's just a [repository](https://github.com/atrof/LibDS) but I develop a "library-like" website using Django framework.<br>

## DATA ANALYSIS

* **Catch me if you can: Intruder Detection** ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Catch%20Me%20If%20You%20Can/AVT_Catch%20Me%20If%20You%20Can.ipynb)). Capstone Project and [in-class competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2) during _Machine Learning & Data Analysis Specialization @Coursera by MIPT & Yandex_. The goal is to identify a user on the Internet tracking his/her sequence of attended web pages and predict whether it belongs to the specific user (Alice) or somebody else.<br>

* **The forecasting of the average wage in Russia** ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Wage_forecasting.ipynb)). Time Series analysis task.<br>
_#Python #TimeSeries #DataVisualization_

* **Mobile Games AB-testing with Cookie Cats** ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/AB-testing%20from%20the%20Cookie%20Cats.ipynb)). As players progress through the levels of the game, they will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait or make an in-app purchase to progress. The target of this project is to decide where to place the gate looking at the impact on player retention.<br>

* **Risk and Returns: The Sharpe Ratio** ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Risk%20%26%20Returns%20with%20the%20Sharpe%20Ratio.ipynb)). Using `pandas` to calculate and compare profitability and risks of different investments using the Sharpe Ratio.<br>
