## Pet Projects
* **TweetLikeTrump** (in progress, [repository](https://github.com/atrof/TweetLikeTrump)) - Flask-based [web application](https://tweetliketrump.herokuapp.com/) which can measure the similarity between yours and Donald Trump's written text. Just for fun and NLP experiments.<br>

* **LibDS** is a curated list of Data Science books. It's just a [repository](https://github.com/atrof/LibDS) but I develop a "library-like" website using Django framework.<br>

## Data Analysis
* **The forecasting of the average wage in Russia** ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Wage_forecasting.ipynb)). Time Series analysis task.<br>
_#Python #TimeSeries #DataVisualization_

* **Mobile Games AB-testing with Cookie Cats** ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/AB-testing%20from%20the%20Cookie%20Cats.ipynb)). As players progress through the levels of the game, they will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait or make an in-app purchase to progress. The target of this project is to decide where to place the gate looking at the impact on player retention.<br>

* **Risk and Returns: The Sharpe Ratio** ([nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/atrof/atrof.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Risk%20%26%20Returns%20with%20the%20Sharpe%20Ratio.ipynb)). Using `pandas` to calculate and compare profitability and risks of different investments using the Sharpe Ratio.<br>

* **Avito Demand Prediction Challenge** (Top 28%, 534/1917). [Kaggle Featured Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-demand-prediction) aimed at predicting demand for an online advertisement based on its description, context and historical demand for similar ads in similar contexts. Just tried a Kaggle Trick with blending public kernels' submissions.<br>
