## Projects
* Catch me if you can: intruder detection.
* How good is your Medium article?
* The forecasting of an average wage in Russia.

## Competitions

## Pet Projects
* **TweetLikeTrump** is a web application which can measure the similarity between yours and Donald Trump's written text. 
* **AIgift.io** 
* **LibDS** is something like «data science library». When I became tired of endless saving one more must read book, I decided to organize a well sctructured library. It's just a repo right now but my plan is to launch a dedicated web application.

## Others
* **3200tweets** is a simple Python script for grabbing tweets using Twitter API and Tweepy package.
* **Dask: when Pandas fails** is an intro-like article (in Russian) about Dask.
